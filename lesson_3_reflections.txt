When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    It would be helpful to use a remote repository when working on different computers, for example a workstation at work and a laptop at home.  It would also be helpful when working with other developers on the same code base.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You might want to always pull changes manually from your remote repository in case you or someone else has made changes on the remote that would conflict with your local copy at the moment.  It may turn out you don't want those changes or that they need to be carefully merged with your local working copy.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A fork makes a clone of a repository on GitHub from one user's space to another user's space.  A clone copies a repository from GitHub or another URL to your local computer.  A branch is a local copy of a project at a certain commit. A fork is used to make your own copy (or another copy) on GitHub of a repository on GitHub, so you can make your own changes without modifying the original repository (for which you may not have permission). A clone is used to make a copy on your own computer of a remote repository, so you can make modifications on your own computer.  A branch is used locally when you want to make a separate copy of the repository to modify without changing the master branch, such as to try out an experimental feature or refactor the code base.
